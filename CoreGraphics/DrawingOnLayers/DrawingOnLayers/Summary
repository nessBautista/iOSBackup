When you add a subview, drawRect method is called to display / re-display
it works as first line of action to draw on the view. What it really is doing is
update the drawings on its Layers.

To draw on CALayers you have 2 scenarios:

1. You have all your drawing code on your underlaying layer, weather is using the graphic context, or just updating the image content

****All the following methods, if defined, are using instead of the drawRect: method.
****The delegate of the CALayer subclass is the UIView subclass

    ----> USING THE LAYER'S DELEGATE
          -(void)displayLayer:(CALayer *)layer. Limited to change only image content
          -(void)drawLayer:(CALayer *)layer inContext:(CGContextRef)context. This can use core graphic functions

    ----> USING THE SUBCLASS APPROACH
          -(void)display{. Limited to change only image content
          -(void)drawInContext:(CGContextRef)context. Able to use graphic the context



2. You have other sublayers in your subview's underlaying layer, weather is using the graphic context, or just updating the image content

****All the following methods, if defined, are using instead of the drawRect: method.
****The delegate is set by updating the delegate PROPERTY on the Layer. It can be set to the View's Layer
    As this is the delegate object of its own Layer.
****A useful architecture for drawing into a layer through a delegate of your choosing is to treat a view
    as a layer-hosting view: The view and its underlying layer do nothing except to serve as a host to a sublayer
    of the view's underlaying layer, which is where the drawing occurs.


    ----> USING THE LAYER'S DELEGATE
          This methods should be overiden on the delegate
          -(void)displayLayer:(CALayer *)layer. Limited to change only image content
          -(void)drawLayer:(CALayer *)layer inContext:(CGContextRef)context. This can use core graphic functions

    ----> USING THE SUBCLASS APPROACH
          -(void)display{. Limited to change only image content
          -(void)drawInContext:(CGContextRef)context. Able to use graphic the context
